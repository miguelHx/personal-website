Why am I getting into blogging? Partly as a way to deepen my own learning, but also to build a stronger online technical presence, and to create a digital trail of my own learning journey.

Short summary about me. I am a software engineer with 3.5 years of experience mainly in full stack web engineering, using Python, Django, JavaScript, Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, and more. I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science & Engineering back in 2019. For a bit more, check out my [about me page](pages/about-me.html).

Over the next couple of years, I plan to revisit the fundamentals of Computer Science and share what I learn along the way. I’ll use this space to distill insights from books, courses, and hands-on projects.

My approach will be to cherry-pick courses from Open Source Society University, the [Computer Science curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) and books recommended by [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/). For now, I'm focusing on the computer science curriculum, currently taking Systematic Program Design and Mathematics for Computer Science.

I will explain why I decided this path in my [next blog post](revisiting-software-fundamentals.html).
