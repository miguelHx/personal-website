Title: About Me

Currently a 4th year Computer Science major @UCM, graduating in Spring 2019.

Passionate about technology, learning, solving problems, and tutoring.

Working with a variety of technologies, such as Python, JavaScript (React.js), Docker, REST, PostgreSQL, to build side projects and contribute to open source projects.

Highly interested in web development, machine learning, mathematics, and the meta-topic “learning how to learn.”

Introvert, slow thinker, and grateful.

I usually spend my free time learning, reading, listening to music, or browsing Quora.
